            Hello, I am
            {% include twitter_link.html %}
            . I'm a software developer based in Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently working on cloud based (AWS, GCP) projects and studying cybersecurity after work.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal for this year is to understand core web application security concepts, and get rewarded in a bug bounty
            program.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will be recording my experiences in programming and security related studies on this blog.
