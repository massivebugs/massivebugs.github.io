This is part 1 of a series of my [Lantern robot project](/post-group/lantern).  
I am going to build a small robot, which I can easily carry around and use as a camera & lantern.  
I expect the design to look something like this:

{% capture items %}
    <img src="/assets/images/unnamed_robot_idea_0.jpg">|
    <img src="/assets/images/unnamed_robot_idea_1.jpg">|
    <img src="/assets/images/unnamed_robot_idea_2.jpg">
{% endcapture %}
{% include swiper.html id="swiper-2" items=items description="Unnamed robot ideas"%}

I am hoping to make a legged robot which will track people (hopefully me), take good photos, and also follow me around and light my steps. 

I'm not entirely sure if this will be possible to make, but I will absolutely try my best.

One of the reasons I started programming was because I wanted to build robots.  
I was inspired after watching videos of robot projects by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/simonegiertz" target="_blank">Simone Giertz</a>, 
and thus bought a book called 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40001922-robot-builder-s-bonanza" target="_blank">
Robot Builder's Bonanza</a> to learn how to make them.  

However, for an absolute beginner with no prior knowledge about computers, programming and electronics, everything was just far too overwhelming. I was quickly disheartened about the sheer amount of things I had yet to understand.  
Plus, I was far too broke to buy decent components for my robots.

{% endcapture %}
{% include swiper.html id="swiper-1" items=items description="Personal robot projects I have made/worked on so far"%}

After several very small scale Arduino/Raspberry Pi robot projects, I finally decided to focus on learning one at a time instead of bashing my head through all of programming and electronics concepts at once.  

That is when I really started to delve into programming, since it was cheaper than buying electronic parts and tools.

2~3 years later, which is now, I want to make a new robot. Just for fun, and to see how far I have gotten.   

Even though I have only been focusing on the software part, I hope I will enjoy the building process with a more calm and fresh mind.
