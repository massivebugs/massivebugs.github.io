This is part 2 of a series of my [Lantern robot project](/post-group/lantern).  
I am going to build a small robot, which I can easily carry around and use as a camera & lantern.  
I made a few very rough sketches and designs of some of the ideas I have for this robot.

#### Project name:
- Lantern 

#### High level overview of what it can be used for
1. Can be used as a **lantern or a lamp**. It has a handle at the top for convenient portability.
    - The light can be turned on/off using voice commands
    - Light brightness can be adjusted

2. Can be used as a **camera**. It can be used for taking good portraits by moving and adjusting position automatically. The handle can also be used to hang it somewhere and use it as a security camera. 
    - The robot tracks people/objects and adjusts it's position to frame a good image.

3. Can be used for **gathering data** for farming (light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture etc).
    - Several sensors will be in place to measure data related to growing vegetables.


#### List of possible features
- Face recognition
- Object tracking
- Camera rotation
- Microphone & voice input
- Speaker & audio feedback 
- LED Light with different lighting modes
- Detachable sensor modules
- 4 to 9 DOF tripod with hopefully some amount of shock absorption
